# credit-risk-classification
In this project, I used various techniques to train a model based on loan risk. The data I used is a historical lending dataset from a lending service company. The model I created evaluated the creditworthiness of borrowers based on if the loan was healthy or high-risk.

This project was done using python in jupyter notebook. The model I created was a logistic Regression model. I evaluated this model using a confusion matrix and classification report. 

My main code can be found in the 'credit_risk_classification' file located in the 'Credit_Risk' folder. The data I used can be found in the 'Resources' folder located in the 'Credit_Risk' folder. My analysis of my model can be found in the 'report-template' file located in the 'Credit_Risk' folder.
